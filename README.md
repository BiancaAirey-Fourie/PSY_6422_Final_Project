For this project I will be looking at the change in adult rape cases across England and Wales from 2016-2022. I think it will be interesting to see the difference in values depending on the geopraghical area. It will also be fascinating to see how events such as COVID-19 and social movement have impacted those numbers.

I got the data from the Criminal Justice website (https://criminal-justice-delivery-data-dashboards.justice.gov.uk/rape-review). While they do not have an explicit code book, they do have a detailed document that goes over how the data was collected and what those variables mean.  

I got a second data set of cooridinates from https://open-geography-portalx-ons.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ons::police-force-areas-december-2018-generalised-clipped-boundaries-ew/explore?showTable=true. 

Merging these two data sets allowed me to create the visualisation.
